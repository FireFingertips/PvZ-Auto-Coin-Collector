# PvZ-Auto-Coin-Collector
A fun little script that detects silver, gold, and diamonds in Plants Vs. Zombies (first game) and collects them automatically.

It let's you select a region of the screen to detect coins then collect them if the match passes a 'confidence threshold'.

You can resume and pause the scrpt in real time, and the keybinds are changeable via keybinds.json file.

There is also some nice acurate statistics of what was collected, time, and total value.

There is a python script file, and there is an exe version that was made thanks to pyinstaller.
